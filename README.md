# Taller-de-video_volumetrico



Course title: ***Video Compression Workshop 2023***

The workshop aims at introducing volumetric video processing, in particular
compression, to students with a previous knowledge on traditional 2D video compression,
and making them comfortable with using this new technology understanding the challenges
related to the bulky size and limitations when streaming and other real time applications are
needed

The course is supported by two **PDF guides**, one for the course instructor and another for the student. These guides will address you to a dowloadable set of other files.
